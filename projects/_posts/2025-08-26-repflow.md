### Open source reflow oven (WIP)
<!--more-->
* * *
RepFlow is an Arduino-powered reflow oven built from a toaster oven. It is capable of solder reflow, as well as drying 3D printer filament.
* * *
The firmware for this project is written using the Arduino framework and runs on an ESP32. It controls the heating elements of a toaster oven using a PID loop with a pair of solid-state relays and a thermocouple. Reflow and drying profiles are read from an SD card as TOML files, allowing for flexible configuration. A 16x4 character LCD and rotary encoder provide a user interface, showing the current stage of the reflow process and allowing for direct modification of the stored profiles.
